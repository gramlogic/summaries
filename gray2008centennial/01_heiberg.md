# Challenges of Present Work
[This section is listed under Heiberg but really pertains to the palimpsest.]
* Text is extremely jumbled.
  * Due to process of creating the prayer book.
* Few copies of Archimedes exist.
  * Not included in the Quadrivium, unlike Euclidean Geometry
  * See Nigel Wilson's 1999 paper: N. G. Wilson, Archimedes: The palimpsest and
the tradition, Byzantinische Zeitschrift 92 (1999), 89–101.
