# Believing the Axioms. I

## Gloss
A preliminary empirical study of mathematical "facts" and evidence used to justify axioms.

### Motive 
Understand "when and why" the facts that support adoption of an axiom are justified.
* Could be of help to mathematicians searching for axioms.

### Method
* Focus on views of the Cabal seminar.
* List the arguments used to justify adoption of the axioms.

Investigates when and why mathematical axioms are justified.

#### Organization
* Part 1 (this paper):
    * Axioms of ZFC
    * Continuum Problem
    * Smal large cardinals and measurable cardinals
* Part 2 ([summarized here](maddy1988believing2.md)):
    * Determinacy hypothesis
    * Large large cardinals
    * Philosophical observations
 
## Dependencies
This paper assumes knowledge of:
* Set theory (basic)

## Background

### [Cabal Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(set_theory))

#### Determinacy

#### Large Cardinal Assumptions

## The Axioms of ZFC
* Starting with these to counteract impression that 
    * ZFC axioms are more "intrinsic" 
    * other axioms candidates are only "extrinsic" 
* Textbooks that "derive" ZFC from the iterative conception encourage this incorrect view
* Even a cursory look at the axioms reveals this characterization doesn't hold up
* Adoption of ZFC axioms "should be viewed as a historical accident, not a sign of their privileged epistemological or metaphysical status"

#### Intrinsic / Extrinsic
This distinction comes up frequently

##### Intrinsic
* Obvious, self-evident
* Following directly from the concept of the set

##### Extrinsic
* Pragmatic, heuristic
* Justified for 
    * consequences,
    * intertheoretic connections
    * explanatory power
* More like techniques of natural sciences

:::{admonition} remark
Maddy introduces the anecdote above as the beginning of the "impulse towards axiomatization," which sounds very general and likely to require a longer discussion. However, her argument makes more sense if understood as giving the historical origns of Zermelo's first axioms.
:::
::::
* Begins in 1883 with Cantor's "law of thought"
    * "It is always possible to bring any _well-defined_ set into the _form of a well-ordered set_.
    * Hallet argues this belief comes from "Cantorian finitism"
    * Mathematical community did not find this obvious
    * 1895: Cantor decided it should really be a theorem and tried to prove it.
    * See Cantor's letter to Dedekind (1899)
* Zermelo proved theorem in 1904
    * Relied on Axiom of Choice (controversial)
    * Zermelo (influenced by Hilbert) hoped to secure proof by listing assumptions it required and proposing them as an axiomatic foundation for set theory.
* Takeaway: these axioms were motivated by desire to prove a theorem, not to avoid paradoxes.
