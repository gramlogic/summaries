# Believing the Axioms. I

## Gloss
A preliminary empirical study of mathematical "facts" and evidence used to justify axioms.

### Motive 
Understand "when and why" the facts that support adoption of an axiom are justified.
* Could be of help to mathematicians searching for axioms.

### Method
* Focus on views of the Cabal seminar.
* List the arguments used to justify adoption of the axioms.

Investigates when and why mathematical axioms are justified.

#### Organization
* Part 1 (this paper):
    * Axioms of ZFC
    * Continuum Problem
    * Smal large cardinals and measurable cardinals
* Part 2 ([summarized here](maddy1988believing2.md)):
    * Determinacy hypothesis
    * Large large cardinals
    * Philosophical observations
 
## Dependencies
This paper assumes knowledge of:
* Set theory (basic)

## Background

### [Cabal Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(set_theory))

#### Determinacy

#### Large Cardinal Assumptions

## The Axioms of ZFC
* Starting with these to counteract impression that 
    * ZFC axioms are more "intrinsic" 
    * other axioms candidates are only "extrinsic" 
* Textbooks that "derive" ZFC from the iterative conception encourage this incorrect view
* Even a cursory look at the axioms reveals this characterization doesn't hold up
* Adoption of ZFC axioms "should be viewed as a historical accident, not a sign of their privileged epistemological or metaphysical status"

### Intrinsic / Extrinsic
This distinction comes up frequently

#### Intrinsic
* Obvious, self-evident
* Following directly from the concept of the set

#### Extrinsic
* Pragmatic, heuristic
* Justified for 
    * consequences,
    * intertheoretic connections
    * explanatory power
* More like techniques of natural sciences
