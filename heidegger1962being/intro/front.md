# First Page
* There is no title to this page. 
* It reads like an abstract for the work, begining with an epigraph.

### Epigraph
* Begins with a quotation from Plato, _Sophistes_, 244a, which Heidegger translates.
* Roughly: 
  * you have been using the word "being" 
  * we thought we understood it
  * now we are perplexed

### Purpose
* We still don't have an answer to Plato's question.
  * still: even in "our time"
* We have lost the perplexity that raises the question.
* The goal of the work is to re-awaken the question of Being.
* Introduction will explain why we should do this.
  * "Exposition of the Question of the Meaning of Being"
