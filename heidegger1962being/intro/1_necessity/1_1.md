# The Necessity for Explicitly Restating the Question of Being

## The Question Today is Forgotten
* Metaphysics has become acceptable again ("progressive")
* But general belief is that we don't have to revisit this question
  * He quotes from Plato's Sophist: "γιγαντομαχία περί της ουσίας"
  * Google translate: "giant battle about substance/essence [ousia]"
* Yet, the question is important.
  * Major theme for Plato and Aristotle
  * Their ideas persisted down to Hegel's "logic" with minor "retouchings"
* Their accomplishments have become trivialized.

### Dogma against inquiry
* Based on Greek's initial contributions
* declares the question about the meaning of being superfluous
* Claims:
  * Being is most universal and emptiest of concepts
  * Undefinable
  * Doesn't need a definition / already understood
* Consquently, asking the question leads to being charged with "an error of method"

### Plan
* Must wait to give an account of the assumptions behind this dogma
  * They are rooted in ancient ontology
  * must first clarify and answer the question of Being
  * "if we are to have regard for the soil from which the basic ontological concepts developed" 
  * "if we are to see whether the categories have been demonstrated in a way that is appropriate and complete"
* Therefore, will only address presuppositions to extent necessary to explain why we must restate the question about the meaning of being

## The 3 presuppositions

### 1: Being is the "most universal" concept
#### position
* quote [Aristotle, Metaphysics: το ον εστι καθολόυ μάλιστα πάντων](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-metaphysics/1933/pb_LCL271.135.xml)
  * Not quite the same quotation... but seems like a close match
* quote Aquinas, _Summa Theologica_: _Illud quod primo cadit sub apprenehsione est ens, cuius intellectus includitur in omnibus, quaecumque quis apprehendit._ Translated as "an understanding of Being is already included in conceiving anything which one apprehends as an entity."

#### counter
* "universality" is not that of a _class_ or _genus_
* Does not define some uppermost realim of entities
* "οὔτε τὸ ὄν γένος" 
  * Google translate: "it is not a genus"
