# Fractured Identities

## The myth of "us"
* Multiple adjectives requires
* Acute consciousness of exclusion
* Identities seem contradictory, partial, strategic
* Nothing "essential" about being female that creates unity
* Even the designation "female" is complex and contested
* Gender, Race, Class consciousness 
  * forced by oppression
  * partriarchy, colonialism, capitalism
* Painful fragmentation trouble the concept of "woman"
  * "an excuse for the matrix of women's dominations of each other"
* Response to crisis has been
  * splitting
  * searches for new "essential" unity
* alternative: coalition  
  * Based on affinity instead of identity

## Effective affinities

### Chela Sandoval's oppositional consciousness
* "woman of color"
* category created by appropriation of negation
* no "natural" identification
* all coalition, affinity, political kinship
* This formulation arises out of anti-colonialist discourse
* Sandoval argues it does not replicate "totalizing" subjects of Marxism / feminism that did not go through decolonization.

### Katie King and unity through taxonomy
* Something about "reading the poem"?
* critizes practice of creating taxonomy that elevates one's own identity
* Fake unity by making one movement appear to be the _telos_
* Incorporate or marginalize everything else

### Failure of epistemologies
* Same work that undermines patriarch, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, etc.
* Also undermines all claims for "natural" standpoint
* Effort to construct revolutionary standpoints
  * "epistemologies as achieves of people committed to changing the world"
  * contributed to discovery of limits of identification
* Ironic allies:
  * "acid-tools" of post-modernist theory
  * "constructive tools" of "ontological discourse about revolutionary subjects"
  * help dissolve "western selves"
* loss of both guilt and innocence

### seeking an alternative myth
* Must embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions
* Must be "faithful" to socialist-feminism
* Need for unity is great
* Must reject:
  * Claim of innocence from practicing dominations
  * Innocence of category of "woman"
  * "natural matrix of unity"
  * Insistence on victimhood as sole ground for insight
* fraying identities opens up possibility

## Caricature of Maxist and Feminist Identities
* Both have naturalized and denatured category of "woman"
* Denature:
  * take away natural qualities
  * break down molecular structure ("as heat denatures a fragile protein")

### Marxian-socialist
* Rooted in wage labor / class structure
* Wage relationship leads to systematic alienation
* Labor is the privileged category
  * enables Marxist to "overcome illusion"
  * humanizing activity
  * ontological category permitting knowledge of the subject

### Socialist-feminism
* allies with basic analytic strategies
* expand category of labor to include some women
  * household labor
  * labor as mothers
* "entered theory on the authority of analogy" to Marxian labor
* sometimes wage relation is under a larger view of labor under capitalist patriarchy
* unity of women 
  * rests on epistemology based on ontological structure of labor
  * Not "naturalized"
* The "ontological structure of labor" is the essentializing part
  * problem: inheritance of Marxian-humanism
* contribution: emphasis on responsibility to build unities

### Against Catherine MacKinnon's radical feminism
* This is not all radical feminism, but MacKinnon is trying to make it seem so
  * logic of her theory shows how epistemology / ontology can erase difference
* Result is a theory of women's identity that is an apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints
* Achieves "unity" by enforcing experience of "radical non-being"
* eliminates some difficulties
* at cost of radical reductionism

#### Strategy
* Identity of "Woman" comes from male desire
* Anything that names sexual violation is women's experience
* sex itself is violation

#### Consequences
* sexual appropriation still has the status of labor
* But the consquence is objectification, not alienation
* Woman does not exist as a potential subject
* Fully constituted by another's desire
* Totalizing in the extreme
* Obliterate's authority of any other women's speech
* Authoritarian / worse than patriarchy 
* But: correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can ground women's unity
* Problem with socialist/Marxian standpoints:
  * unintended erasue of polyvocal constituency
* Contrast with MacKinnon's _intentional_ erasure of all difference
  * using "essential" non-existence

### Conclusions

* Both Socialist-feminism and radical feminism are partial
  * radical feminism can only accomodate all activities of women if they can all be sexualized
  * [I think the implication is that they cannot]
* reproduction has two meanings in the two traditions: labor and sex
* Both call ignorance of social / personal reality "false consciousness"
* Both constituted as "totalities"
  * attempted to simply expand categories by analogy
  * or "simple listing, or addition"
  * result: embarrassed silence about race among both white radical and socialist-feminists
  * no structural room for race

#### Caricature structure:
##### Socialist-feminism
* class structure --> wage labor --> alienation by labor
* analogy to repoduction
* extension to sex
* addition of race

##### radical feminism
* structure of gender --> sexual appropriation --> objectification sex
* analogy to labor
* extension to reproduction
* addition of race

#### History of categories
* Julia Kristeva claimed women appeared as a historical group after WWII
* dates "doubtful"
* But the point is that these categories of identity have a "historical genesis"

#### Moment of "End of man", risk of difference
* "It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man---and so the essence of woman---breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection among people on the planet are unprecendentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex."
* "Advanced capitalism" is inadequate to convey this moment.
* Woman disintegrates into women.
* Socialist feminists may have participating in logic / language / practice of white humanism
* Now, aware of failures, risk "boundless difference"
* Epistemology is about knowing which differences are important.
