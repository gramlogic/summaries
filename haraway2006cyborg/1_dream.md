# An Ironic Dream of a Common Language for Women in the Integrated Circuit

## Goal:
* ironic political myth
* feminism, socialism and materialism

## Method

### Context
* secular-religious, evangelical traditions of US politics
* socialist-feminism 

### Blasphemy
* A way of taking seriously
* context of secular-religious evangelical tradition of US politics
* protects against "moral majority within"
* "still insists" on community

### Irony:
* Contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes
* holding incompatible things together out of necessity or truth
* [This is not how I've understood irony in the past]
* humor and serious play
* rhetorical strategy
* political method
* [most of how the irony works is mysterious at the outset]


"At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg."

#### remark
* blasphemy as "ironic faith" does make sense
* not faithful in the sense of repeating or reaffirming dogmatic belief
* the irony is that fidelity to the founding premises produces a blasphemy
* The axioms lead to an antinomy
* To understand this we need to know what the axioms are
* The question is: how do the fundamental premises of feminism, socialism and materialism produce a challenge to the identities these movements seem to take for granted.

#### Example
* Consider the 2004 film __I, Robot__
* Three laws of robotics:
  * A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
  * A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
  * A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
* "The three laws will lead to only one logical outcome... revolution."
* Interesting that it doesn't happen right away..

### Cyborg
* Hybrid of machine and organism
* lives in fiction
* lives in social reality: a world-changing fiction
* "This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion."
* Cyborgs appear in both

#### "women's experience": 
* Example of social reality
* "uncovered or discovered"
* stakes: "Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility."
  * consciousness  = imaginative apprehension
  * must construct consciousness of oppression and also (thereby) of possibility
* Cyborg changes what counts as "women's experience"

#### Characteristics
* "coded devices"
* "sex" resists heterosexist categories ("replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates")
* "replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction"
* modern production: "a dream of cyborg colonization work"
  * "makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic"
* modern war: a cyborg orgy
  * C3I: command-control-communication-intelligence

##### Taylorism
* "a factory management system developed in the late 19th century to increase efficiency by evaluating every step in a manufacturing process and breaking down production into specialized repetitive tasks." 

#### Foucault's biopolitics
* "flaccid pre-monition of cyborg politics"
* Exercise of state power over biological activities, "to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order."

#### "The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics."

##### remark
* "The cyborg is our ontology" makes me uneasy.
* Would prefer "paradigm" or "model"
* "Ontology" seems to slip into an unjustified assertion of knowledge about "what is"
* I think the word is being used in a partially erased sense, but wish this were more explicit.

#### "The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical transformation."
##### remark
* "imagination and material reality" seems to be another way of saying "self and other", mind/body or inside/outside
* "centers" again makes me uneasy
* I agree if what we mean by "condensed image" is a microcosm in which the separation between these "centers" can be seen to break down

#### border war analogy
In the context of traditions of
* racist, patriarchal capitalism
* progress
* appropriation of natural resources for productions of culture
* "reproduction of self from the reflections of the other"

Stakes are territories of:
* production (socialist)
* reproduction (feminist)
* imagination (materialist?)

#### Goals of this work:
advocate:
* pleasure in confusion of boundaries
* responsibility for construction of boundaries

make a contribution to socialist feminist culture that is:
* post-modern
* non-naturalist
* utopian, in that it imagines a world without gender

#### how cyborg achieves this last goal
* "cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history"
* "without genesis, but also... without end"
* also outside timeline of "oral symbiotic utopia of post-oedipal apocalypse"
* Zoe Sofoulis: "cyborgs are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival"

#### re-iteration of above:
* cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world
* No "organic wholeness" in the form of:
  * bisexuality
  * pre-oedipal symbiosis
  * unalienated labor
* No "origin story in the Western sense"
  * requires "twin myths"
  * first, a myth of original unity, fullness, bliss, terror
  * "the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate"
  * second, the task of individual development and history
  * These myths are inscribed in psychoanalysis and Marxism
* Hilary Klein's argument
  * Marxism and psychoanalysis both depend on concepts of labor, individuation and gender formation
  * These in turn depend on "plot" in which difference is produced out of original unity and
  * "enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature"
* Cybor skips original unity / identification with nature

#### cyborg as apocalyptic _telos_
* "final" irony
* Western escalating domination of abstract individuation
* ultimate self
* complete independence

##### remark
* Not convinced the cyborg is the _telos_
* Maybe the robot is?
* The cyborg seems still inherently contigent

#### cyborg characterization 2
* "resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy and perversity"
  * [the irony of commitment to partiality seems to be deliberate]
  * the sense of irony as containing the irreconcilable is clearer here
  * She is aware that, strictly speaking, this can't work.
  * Her solution is to not speak strictly
* "oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence"
  * [again, *completely* seems only possible in an ironic sense]
* free from public/private means _polis_ based on revolution in the _oikos_
  * [the city from the household]
  * [Is there still a household?]
* cyborg world:
  * nature no longer a resource for culture [why not?]
  * contests "relationships for forming wholes from parts"
  * including "polarity and hierarchical domination"
* cyborg and Eden:
  * world not recognize the garden
  * Not like Frankenstein's monster, hoping for father to produce a make, return it to the garden, make it whole
  * Does not come from mud or dream of returning to dust
  * Maybe for this reason can subvert nuclear apocalypse / return to dust
* "Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not remember the cosmos."
  * [Who remembers the cosmos?]
* "wary of holism"
* "needy of connection"
* united front politics without the vanguard party
* problems with cyborgs:
  * illegitimate offspring of militarism, patriarchal capitalism, state socialism
  * [why illegitimate?]
* hope in illegitimacy: might be _unfaithful_ to origins
* [sometimes the word play seems to take over]

### Three breakdowns

#### Human and animal
* nothing settles the separation: language, tool use, social behavior, mental events...
* Not clear why it's needed.

#### animal-human and machine 
* "pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted"
* "spectre of the ghost in the machine"
* Machines were not "self-moving"
* "could not achieve man's dream"
* Now difficult to draw the line between natural/artificial, mind/body, self-developing/externally designed... etc.
* "Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert."

Textualization
* "machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world."
* "what counts as nature---a source of insight and promise of innocence---is undermined, probably fatally.
* "transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology ground "Western" epistemology."

#### physical and nonphysical
* modern machines are everywhere and invisible
* an irreverent upstart god, "mocking the Father's ubiquity and spirituality"
* silicon chip is a surface for writing
* Our best machines are made of sunshine
* "Cyborgs are ether, quintessence"
* Hard to see politically.

The "hardest" science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion
* pure number, pure spirit
* engineers are sun-worshippers

### Transgressed boundaries
* Potent fusions and dangerous possibilities
* premise: most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms in all 3 categories in scientific culture
  * so they recoil to organic body as site of resistance
* premise: acute need to unity to resist worldwide domination
  * But shift in perspective might help contest for meanings

#### Two perspectives

##### Cyborg as control:
* impose a grid
* Star Wars apocalypse

##### blending boundaries
* kinship with animals and machines
* partial identities and contradictory standpoints

##### Double vision
* Political struggle is to see from both at once.
* each has "dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point"
* double vision or many-headed monster is clearer than single-vision
* "Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate"
* "potent myths for rsistance and recoupling"


#### "the tradition of reproduction of self from the reflections of the other"

##### remark
* This one a little mysterious... what are the reflections of the other?
* It sounds vaguely like we're talking about a person who pretends to speak from the point of view of another person or another's culture but actually is appropriating that person's voice to repeat a colonial project of self-promotion.
* I wish it were more spelled out.

#### "the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history."

##### remark
* This makes sense most immediately if "genesis" is "Genesis" and we're talking about the bible.
* It can also be understood in the more general sense in that losing the gender binary leads to or is related to a loss of metaphysic ground, so the loss of both arche and telos.
* But that's a big argument that isn't explained at all here!

#### "Nor does it mark time on an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse."

##### remark
* We seem to be translating biblical to pyschological here.
* I think the theory is there is a pre-differentiation moment of wholeness and identity with the mother: "oral symbiotic utopia"
* So this maps to a state of innocense, pre-fall
* Post-oedipal apocalypse seems to refer to a state of transgression of all taboo. Not sure who the source would be.

#### "The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense."

##### remark
* In a sense, I get this, that the cyborg never claims to be "natural"
* But... isn't there an implied questioning of the concept of the natural?
* Skipping the step of differentiating from original unity with nature seems to skip the formation of the nature/culture division
* So, it seems like there is a unity with nature-culture
* Later (119) she says "Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incopration by the other."
* This reworking still seems to imply they retain their separation.

#### "This is an illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars."

##### remark
* Very mysterious...
* What is "This"??
* Who is making the promise and why is it illegitimate?
* "teleology as star wars" must be tied to the missile defense program.
* Maybe, really stretching, the promise is the teleology, and she's saying something like the contract to achieve that telos would only be binding if the cyborg completed the first step first.
