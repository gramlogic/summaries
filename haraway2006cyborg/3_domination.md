# The Informatics of Domination

## Politics rooted in moment of change
* Goal: sketch a picture of possible unity
  * indebted to socialist / feminist design
* Context: rearrangements in worldwide social relations 
  * tied to science and technology
  * analogous to change of industrial capitalism
  * movement to information system
  * simultaneously material and ideological
  * **"scary new networks"** = "informatics of domination"

### Big chart (excerpted rows)
* Representation --> Simulation
* Bourgeois novel / realism --> Science fiction / post-modernism
* Organism --> Biotic compoent
* Family / Market / Factory --> Women in the Integrated Circuit
* Public / private --> Cyborg citizenship
* Nature / cuture --> Fields of difference
* Freud --> Lacan 
* Labor --> Robotics
* Mind --> Artificial Intelligence
* White Capitalist Patriarchy --> Informatics of Domination

#### Takeaways from chart
* Objects on the right are not "natural"
* This means left is not "natural" either
* Cannot go back.
* Both "god" and "goddess" are dead
  * Or revivified in microelectronic / biotechnological politics
* biotic components
  * not "essential properties"
  * design, boundaries, rates of flows, etc.
* Sexual reproduction: one reproductive strategy among others
* No natural "organisms" or "families"
* Racial ideologies must be formulated as frequencies of parameters
  * for groups, must use "developed" or "underdeveloped
* Many old categories become "Irrational"
* Anything can be disassembled and reassembled (Remark 1)
* No "natural" architectures
* Cyborg semiologies:
  * Objects that can be "known" scientifically must be formulated as:
    * communications engineering problems (for managers)
    * theories of the text (for the resistance)
* Control strategies:
  * No longer focused on natural objects
  * Instead: interfaces, boundaries, rates of flow
  * Integrity of self --> decision procedures / expert systems
  * For birth, language of control will be
    * polution control
    * maximization of goal achievement
    * rates, costs, degrees of freedom
* Humans are components or subsystems (Remark 2)
  * part of system architecture
  * probabilistic and statistical
* No sacred objects (Remark 1)
  * Any object can interface with any other
  * Requires "proper component" for processing signals
* Exchange "transcends" universal translation of capitalist market
* Privileged pathology is "stress" / communication breakdown
* "The cyborg is not subject to Foucault's biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field"

#### Remarks
* Recall Benjamin's surgeon and disassembly as it relates to the aura and the sacred object
* Recall Vinge's nightmare of humans as signal processors

### Work ahead for feminist politics 
* Old categories have been "techno-digested"
* Replaced by "informatics of domination"
* This dissolution makes oppositional international movements hard to imagine
* Also necessary to imagine
* Feminist theory and practice must address science and technology
* Especially myth and imagination 
* Must "code" the cyborg self

#### Dichotomies in Question 
* mind / body
* animal / human
* organism / machine
* public / private
* nature / culture
* men / women
* primitive  / civilized

#### Remarks
* "Techno" makes sense in light of writing as techne

## Technology and myth
* New social relations coming from
  * communication technology
  * biotechnology
* Scientific discourse
  * "formalization" (frozen moment)
  * enforcer of meaning
* permeable boundary between
  * tool and myth
  * instrument and concept
  * historical systems of social relations (empirical?)
  * and historical anatomies of possible bodies (formal?)
* "myth and tool mutually consitute each other"
  * myth seems to be allied with forms here
  * so myth gives possible tools
  * but then tools enforce myths
  * at least, maybe...

## Coding Problems
The _translation of the world into a problem of coding_
* "search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange."

### Communication Sciences
* cybernetic systems (feedback controlled)
* telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, data base construction / maintenance
* language and control

#### Information
* key operation: determine rates, directories, probabilities of flow of information
* boundaries of world are "differentially permeable to information"
* quantifiable
* allows universal translation
* therefore unhindered instrumental power
* metaphor is C^3 I: command-control-communication-intelligence
* military operations theory 

#### Remarks
* It sounds like Haraway is against a common language...

#### threats
* communication breakdown
* a function of "stress"

### Biology
* examples: molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory, immunobiology
* "The organism has been translated into problems of genetic coding and read-out."
* Organism has ceased to exist as object of knowledge
* Becomes "biotic components" = "special kinds of information processing devices"
* ecology: analogy in history of concepts of the ecosystem
* immunobiology (and associated medicine): privilege of coding and recognition systems
  * biology as a kind of cryptography
  * stressed system experiences communication breakdown
  * fails to differentiate between self and other

#### "Ironies abound"
* Human babies with baboon hearts
  * provoke animal rights activitist and guardians of human purity
* HIV
  * marks the body
  * confusion of boundaries
  * "moral pollution"

### Microelectronics
* economic reality underlying everything now
* from states, to medicine to pornography
* The "technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals."
* mediates translations:
  * labor --> robotics and word processing
  * sex --> genetic engineering / reproductive technologies
  * mind --> artificial intelligence and decision procedures

#### Remarks
* Reference to Baudrilliard seems to convey Baudrillard's confusion.
* Copies of course have predecessors, or "relative" originals.
* What is more difficult to conceive of is an absolute original.
* Unfortunately Baudrilliard does not understand this.

### Conclusions for biology and communication technology
* machine and organism are blurred
* mind / body / tool all mixed
* weakening of: base and superstructure, public and prviate, material and ideal

#### Women in the Integrated Circuit
* Rachel Grossman
* Names situation in which women are in a world that is "intimately restructured" through "social relations of science and technology"
* "social relations" is meant to indicate we are not dealing with technological determinism
* But also science and technology are "fresh sources of power" and we need "fresh sources of analysis and ... action"
* "Rearrangements of race, sex, class rooted in high-tech-facilitated social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant" and effective.
