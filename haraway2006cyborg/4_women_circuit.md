# Women in the Integrated Circuit

Misleading to characterize women's lives by public / private distinction.
* factory / home (working class)
* market / home (bourgeois)
* personal / political (gender)
Even showing mutual construction is no good.

Network ideological image
* preferred
* profusion of spaces, identities
* permeability of boundaries
* Networking as feminist practice
* but also multinational corporate strategy
* "weaving is for oppositional cyborgs"

Women's "place" in the integrated circuit
* From informatics of domination
* Idealized social locations:
  * Home, market, paid work place, state, school, clinic-hospital, church

* Home
