"One might conjecture that division in man
between conscious and unconscious thought occurs at the boundary between
stimulus-response heuristics which do not have to be reasoned about but only
obeyed, and the others which have to serve as premises in deductions." (p. 10)

"What this leads to is that the notion of deductive logic
being something sitting there sacred which you can borrow for particularly
sacred uses and producing inviolable results is a lot of nonsense. Deductive
logic is inferrred as much as anything else. Most women have never inferred
it, but they get along pretty well, marrying happy husbands, raising happy
children, without ever using deductive logic at all. My feeling is that my
criticism of Dr. McCarthy is the other way. He assumes deductive logic,
whereas in fact that is something to be concocted."


"Prof. Bar-Hillel has correctly observed that
my paper is based on unstated philosophical assumptions although what
he means by “pseudo-philosophical” is unclear. Whenever we program a
computer to learn from experience we build into the program a sort of epistemology. It might be argued that this epistemology should be made explicit
before one writes the programme, but epistemology is in a foggier state than
computer programming even in the present half-baked state of the latter.
I hope that once we have succeeded in making computer programs reason
about the world, we will be able to reformulate epistemology as a branch of
applied mathematics no more mysterious or controversial than physics." (p. 14-15)

"What
we disagree on is my contention that the conceptual difficulties arise at the
present level of complexity and that solving them will allow us to increase
the complexity of the model easily." (p. 15)
