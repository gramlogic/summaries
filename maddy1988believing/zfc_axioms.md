# ZFC Axioms 

```{admonition} Extensionality
:class: dropdown

Two sets are equivalent if and only if they contain the same members.
* I.e. equivalence does not depend on the way a set was specified.

Maddy's commmentary
* seemingly most "definitional" axiom
* "distinguishes sets from intensional entities like properties or concepts"
* most writers seem to view as analytic

Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel and Levy give following argument:
  * simpler, clearer, more convenient
  * unique (vs. equivalence of "intensional" collections
  * flexible: can always distinguish between sets when needed by taking a cross product

Maddy notes these are **extrinsic** justifications, even in this most "obvious" case.

```{admonition} remark
Boolos: "if any sense can be made of the distinction between analytic and synthetic, then the Axiom of Extensionality should be counted as analytic."
* Need to dig into the synthetic / analytic debate.

Aka "Regularity"

Every non-empty set is disjoint with at least one of its elements.

Note: This does not appear in Enderton until very late.
