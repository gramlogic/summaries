# Believing the Axioms. I
The first part of Penelope Maddy's study of arguments and reasoning that have led to the adoption of mathematical axioms.

## Quick Overview
```{tabbed} Gloss
A preliminary empirical study of mathematical "facts" and evidence used to justify axiom.
```
```{tabbed} Goals 
Understand "when and why" the facts that support adoption of an axiom are justified.

**Application:**
* Could be of help to mathematicians searching for axioms.
```
```{tabbed} Method
* Focus on views of the Cabal seminar.
* Review axioms that were actually accepted.
* List the arguments used to justify their adoption.
```
```{tabbed} Organization
Part 1 (this paper):
* Axioms of ZFC
* Continuum Problem
* Small large cardinals and measurable cardinals

Part 2 ([summarized here](maddy1988believing2/gloss.md)):
* Determinacy hypothesis
* Large large cardinals
* Philosophical observations
```
```{tabbed} Dependencies 
This paper assumes knowledge of:
* Set theory (basic)

Useful terms and concepts:
* [Cabal Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(set_theory))
* Determinacy
* Large Cardinal Assumptions
