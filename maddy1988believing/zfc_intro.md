:open:

**Intrinsic**
* Obvious, self-evident
* Following directly from the concept of the set

**Extrinsic**
* Pragmatic, heuristic
* Justified for 
    * consequences,
    * intertheoretic connections
    * explanatory power
* More like techniques of natural sciences
```

Starting with these to counteract impression that:
* ZFC axioms are more "intrinsic" 
* other axioms candidates are only "extrinsic" 

Textbooks give this incorrect impression when they
* begin by "deriving" ZFC from the iterative conception
* introduce further axioms with more analysis (pros/cons)
* implies that some axioms are intrinsic and others extrinsic

Claims:

The causes of this "accident" warrant some analysis.

* Even if we accept the intrinsic / extrinsic divisiion, this classification does not separate ZFC axioms from the rest
* Adoption of ZFC axioms "should be viewed as a historical accident, not a sign of their privileged epistemological or metaphysical status"

## The origins of ZFC
````{margin}
```{admonition} remark
:class: hint
Maddy introduces the anecdote above as the beginning of the "impulse towards axiomatization," which sounds very general and likely to require a longer discussion. However, her argument makes more sense if understood as giving the historical origns of Zermelo's first axioms.
```
````
* Begins in 1883 with Cantor's "law of thought"
    * "It is always possible to bring any _well-defined_ set into the _form of a well-ordered set_.
    * Hallet argues this belief comes from "Cantorian finitism"
    * Mathematical community did not find this obvious
    * 1895: Cantor decided it should really be a theorem and tried to prove it.
    * See Cantor's letter to Dedekind (1899)
* Zermelo proved theorem in 1904
    * Relied on Axiom of Choice (controversial)
    * Zermelo (influenced by Hilbert) hoped to secure proof by listing assumptions it required and proposing them as an axiomatic foundation for set theory.
* Takeaway: these axioms were motivated by desire to prove a theorem, not to avoid paradoxes.
