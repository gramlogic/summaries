# Introduction
A preliminary empirical study of mathematical "facts" and evidence used to justify axiom.

## Motivation
The choice of axioms is not obvious, and must be defended.

Axioms as "self-evident" assumptions:
* Some have turned out to be questionable.
* Example: Law of excluded middle.
* Others lead to contradictions.
* Example: "every property determines a set"
Understand "when and why" the facts that support adoption of an axiom are justified.
* Needed 

### Applications
* Could be of help to mathematicians searching for axioms.

## Method
* Focus on views of the Cabal seminar.
* Review axioms that were actually accepted.
* List the arguments used to justify their adoption.

## Organization
* Axioms of ZFC
* Continuum Problem
* Small large cardinals and measurable cardinals
