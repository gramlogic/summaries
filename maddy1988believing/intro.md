# Introduction
This paper provides a preliminary empirical study of mathematical "facts" and evidence used to justify axioms.

## Motivation
```{admonition} Axiom choices are not self-evident.
:class: danger

Among axioms once considered self-evident:
* Some choices turned out to be questionable (e.g., Law of excluded middle).
* Others have led to contradictions (e.g., "every property determines a set")

Among current axiom candidates for set-theory:
* Some are not obvious to anyone. 
```
```{admonition} Any choice of axioms must be defended.
:class: tip

* "the question of how the unproven can be justified"
* **Methodology** of trial and error (scientific method from natural sciences).
* Central problem in philosophy of natural science: what counts as evidence?
  * Same is true in mathematics.
  * Historically little attention to classification of mathematical facts, or question of why they are evidence.
    * Maybe because of the "self-evident" view.
    * Maybe "complacent if-thenism"
* To evaluate a choice, we must understand "when and why" the facts that support adoption of an axiom are justified.
* This in turn requires a review of what these whens and whys have been, historically.
```
Further reasons to understand mathematical hypothesis formation:
* "Contribute to our philsophical understanding of the nature of mathematics"
* Set theory: axioms sought to determine the size of the continuum.
  * Better understanding could help mathematicians in this search. 

## Method of this study
* Focus on views of the Cabal seminar.
* Review axioms that were actually accepted.
* List the arguments used to justify their adoption.

## Organization of part I
* Axioms of ZFC
* Continuum Problem
* Small large cardinals and measurable cardinals

### remark
The fundamental assumptions behind Maddy's line of inquiry are radical:
* The authority of axioms comes from empirical, experimental results.
* The rules for evaluating the success or failure of these experiments are not explicit; it is Maddy's goal to describe them.
* This can be accomplished (or at least begun) through a historical study of the behavior of its practitioners rather than by any logical or deductive process.
