# Introduction
* computer revolution as rewriting of the world
* as translation
* software replaces prose

## Thesis
* computing grew out of the arts
* disagreement with line between "two cultures"

## Science before the revolution
* Before the scientific revolution (17th century), there were no scientists in Europe.
* most sciency stuff was "natural philosophy"
* published in Latin
* _scientia_ means more like "knowledge"
* Professional engineers came even later
* What did exist:
  * liberal arts: logic, grammar, rhetoric
  * mechanical arts: producing pins, stockings, locks, guns, jewelry
* software arts came from both

## Method
* Partly historical, tracing a genealogy
* "also a reading of the texts of computing"
* historically, the continuity between prose and programs goes back to 17th century
### thesis:
* artificial philosophical languages for combining liberal arts and mechanical arts became programming languages
* contemporary formulation: art, design, the humanities and technology
* programming langauges come from effort to describe mechanical arts in the languages of the liberal arts
* writing software is like writing novels, plays, etc.
* Implication: need to change education to recognize this

### remark
* I'm not sure I'm convinced writing software is like writing plays.
