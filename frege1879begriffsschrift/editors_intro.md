# Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought
* Gottlob Frege
* 1879

## Contributions
* truth-functional propositional calculus
* proposition as function and argument (instead of subject and predicate)
* theory of quantification
* system of logic in which derivations are purely syntactical
* logical definition of a mathematical sequence

## Motivations
* Mathematics as point of departure
* How to give a logical analysis of a sequence?

## Project
* Begriffsschift
* language of concepts
* "ideography"
* "formal language"
* _lingua characterica_ (special symbols)

### Pure thought
* no rhetorical embellishments
* modeled on arithmetic (but must remain distinct from it!)
* "to express a content through written signs in a more precise and clear way than it is possible to do through words"
* "not a mere _calculus rationcinator_ but a _lingua characterica_ in Leibniz's sense" (1882, pp 1-2)

### functional approach
* mathematical statements don't have a subject / predicate
* sentences still make sense when words are substituted for others
* Does not define a function here.
* Later, lots of work devoted to defining a function.

#### remark
* The function's arguments express possible metaphorical substitutions.

### two dimensional notation
* Did not survive.
* Too hard to print and takes up too much space.
* Advantages: perceive structure a glance, make substitutions easily

### features of propositional calculus
* 6 axioms (not independent)
* 2 rules of inference:
  * detachment
  * substitution (unstated / must be deduced from examples)
* truth-table method

#### conditional
* purely truth-functional
* discusses differences from "if"

### quantification theory
* rules for italic and German letters
  * gives rule of generalization + another
* 3 new axioms (instantiation and identity)
 
### absent
* completeness, consistency, independence
* dismisses modality 
* explicit rule of substitution
* definition of function

#### note on functional letters
* permitted to occur in a quantifier
* not necessary in general
* needed by Frege for 3rd section of book
* blurs difference between function and argument
* This is what Russell uses to create the paradox.

### Come back
* "rule that allows us to infer... when x does not occur free in A"
* Discussion of substitution involving "syntactic variable"
* p. 24 phi(A) could be a function of argument phi as well as of A
* "If a functional letter occurs in a quanitifier, 'this circumstance must be taken into account'
  * meaning?
