#### Philosophical modifiers
* Realism: assertion of mind-independent existence (combined with other things)
* Skepticism: questioning the possibility of knowledge
* Positivism: All genuine knowledge is either "positive" or tautological.
  * Positive: A posteriori and derived from experience of natural phenomena and their properties and relations
  * Based on empiricism
* Idealism
* Empiricism: The belief that knowledge comes from sensory experience
* Rationalism: The theory that reason is the chief source of knowledge
* Foundationalism: the belief that knowledge rests on some secure foundation of certainty (whether empirical or rational).
* Correspondence theory of truth: truth or falsity of statement dependence on correspondence to an actual state of affairs. This is the traditional view.
* Coherence theory of truth: truth is coherence within some set of sentences, propositions or beliefs
  * The above definition means a lot of things could be tolerated as true
* Nihilism
* Confirmation holism / epistemological holism: the view no individual statement can be confirmed or disproved by an empirical test, but only a whole theory.
  * Quine, Duhem-Quine thesis ("web of belief")
  * "Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system."

Kant's
* Analytic / Synthetic
* A priori / a posteriori

There may not be such a thing as certain knowledge. Unfortunately, we can't say for sure. 

## Relation to IOR
The philosophy jargon summary is:
* We begin with a correspondence theory of truth.
* It must have some foundation: perhaps either in empiricism or rationalism.
* This falls back into a coherence theory of truth.
* Still need a way to arbitrate between systems.
  * If we get to this point I believe I am at liberty to argue for the one I like best.
