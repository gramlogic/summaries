"Big Literary Find in Constantinople"
* No author (anonymous scribe)
* _literary_, not _mathematical_.

"The fact that Prof. Heiberg copied the Archimedes manuscript apparently indicates that it consisted, entirely or in part, of works by Archimedes that have hitherto been lost, for he would hardly have taken the trouble to transcribe the books on plane geometery, solid geometry, arithmetic, and mechanics which have come down to us from among the writings by the great Greek."
* Has no idea what's actually in it.

"Perhaps, even, the manuscript found at Constantinople may contain the work on notation which Archimedes is supposed to have written and which, when it was lost, meant the loss to the world of the system he invented."
* What is this?

"the discovery is of extraordinary interest as showing that ancient manuscripts do exist in Constantinople...It may even be that careful search would result in the discovery of the lost books of Livy and Cicero and many other treasures of antiquity that vanished between the close of the classical age and the Renaissance."

"Perhaps, indeed, the book the loss of which was the greatest literary loss the world ever suffered, the Poems of Sappho, will be at last recovered..."

"...and one of the chief objects of the proposed excavation of Herculaneum will be attained in another way"
* Herculaneum was an ancient town buried under volanic ash when Mount Vesuvius erputed in AD 79.

## Against the Turks
* This article is deeply steeped in anti Turk sentiment.

"Whether the Turks Destroyed the Libraries when They Took the City Always a Disputed Question"
* We now believe it was the Crusaders who did this in 1204.

"the old legend, 'Where the Turk's foot is planted grass never grows again,' does not apply to all the libraries that were in the city when Mohammed II took it in 1453.

"it has always been a disputed question whether the Turks destroyed or preserved the libraries they found in Constantinople."

"It is known that the Turk was always reluctant to destroy writing, lest perchance it should contain the name of God, but a good many scholars have been of the opinion that this scruple did not weigh with Mohammed and his followers when they entered the great city and started to make a bonfire of the treasures of antiquity that were contained in it."

"Some years ago J. C. Robinson obtained permission to enter the Sultan's library of manuscripts, and saw 3,000 of them upon the wall. He came to the conclusion that Western scholars had examined them long before and that there was nothing of value in them. As a matter of fact, there is no record of any such examination."

"Meredith Townsend, in 'Asia and Europe,' made an appeal for the examination of this library. He said: 'The Sultan's library should be searched through as the first condition of the next loan made to Turkey--if there ever is another--and permission demanded to hunt for that older and more valuable store of manuscripts believed or known to be stored in the crypt of St. Sophia... That is the last place left where we shall be likely to make a great literary find, and it should be searched before the great day when the destiny of the Ottomans is completed, and Constantinople once more sinks down, a mass of blood-stained ruins, fired by its possessors before they commence their final retreat to the desert from which, in the mysterious province of God, they were suffered to emerge in order to destroy the eastern half of the civilized world. The only other chance is in the Shereefal Palace, at Morocco, and it is uncertain if a library exists there.'"

Author adds the "Chinese Empire" too.

"But the Danish savant's discovery in Constantinople indicates that that city is by far the best hunting ground for the modern Humanists, if any still exist."
