# Exergue
Writing before the Letter

## Triple exergue
### Sources
* A (Babylonian) scribe, from EP 87 aka "L'Ã©criture et la psychologie des peuples" 
  * Writing and the psychology of people
* Rousseau, _Essai sur l'origine des langues_
* Hegel, _Enzyklopadie_

## Purposes

### Not Only:
The point of the exergue is not just to Focus on the following aspects of the concept of writing:
* ethnocentrism
* logocentrism (metaphysics of phonetic writing), which controls:
  1. _the concept of writing_ (phoneticization of writing hides its own history)
  2. the history of metaphysics (pre-Socratics to Heidegger), which assigns origin of truth to logos
    * history of truth
    * truth of truth
    * = debasement of writing
    * one exception, to be explained
  3. The concept of science, always determined as logic, despite the challenge of nonphonetic writing.
    * "subversion has always been contained within a system of direct address"
    * Peculiar moment: phoneticization of writing extends to world culture, science is no longer satisfied with it
    * Inadequation (of phonetic writing) was always at work, but now legible, taking over.
      * Not a mutation, explication, accumulation, revolution or tradition. 
      * These describe historical movement meaningful within the system that is being "dislocated"
      * History is also part of logocentric epoch.

#### Remarks
* What is "direct address"?
* Why this list: "mutation, explication, accumulation, revolution or tradition"?

### But Also:
The exergue does two more things:
1. Announce that a science of writing 
  * "reined in by metaphor, metaphysics and theology"
    * Not just _explicit_ "theological predujices"
  * "shows signs of liberation all over the world"
    * result of "decisive efforts" that are "discreet, dispersed, almost imperceptible"
  
2. At the same time, "runs the risk of never being established as such and with that name."
  * despite being "fecund" and "necessary"
  * even if it overcomes "technical," "epistemological" obstacles and "theological and metaphysical impediments"
  * May not be able to:
    * "define the unity of its project"
    * "write its discourse on method"
    * "define the limits of its field"
  * "Essential reasons" for this:
    * Attempt at "unity" of science and writing is determined by "historico-metaphysical" epoch of the logos
      * "we glimpse the _closure_" of this epoch
    * The ideas of science, writing, and science of writing are meaningful only
      * "in terms of an origin"
      * "within a world"
      * to which a certain concept of the sign has already been assigned
      * carries with it a certain concept of the relationship between speech and writing
      * this relationship is "determined"
      * despite "privilege," "necessity" and "field of vision" "it has controlled for a few millenia"
      * "now able to produce its own dislocation and itself proclaim its limits"

## Proposal
* investigation of "what is still provisionally called writing"
* "letting it ... develop its positivity as far as possible"
* This method may be "faithful ... to the ... world of the future ... beyond the closure of knowledge"

### The future
* "an absolute danger"
* "breaks absolutely with constituted normality"
* "can only be proclaimed, _presented_, as a sort of monstrosity"
* No exergue yet to guide what immediately precedes such a future ("future anterior").

#### Remark
* Like Abelson's suggestion about computer science.
* The study of writing is really the study of something else.
