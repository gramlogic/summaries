# The Program

## slow advent of writing
* slow movement over 20 centuries
* everthing that became "language" now is becoming "writing"
* hardly perceptible
* concept of writing is no longer derivative or auxillary
* "beginning to go beyond the extension of language"

### signifier of the signifier
* still writing
* no longer "accidental doubling"
* the movement of language
* the structure of the origin of writing
* "conceals and erases itself in its own production"
* "There the signified always already functions as a signifier."
* "Secondarity" particular to writing actually affects "all signifieds in general"
* the moment they "enter the game"

### the game
* What is this?
* Something related to play.
* "not a single signified that escapes, even if recaptured"
* What does "recapture" look like?

### play
* "the advent of writing is the advent of this play"
* "effacing the limit starting from which one had thought to regulate the circulation of signs"
* "reducing all the... out-of-bounds shelters that watched over the field of language"
* The metaphor is of playing a game.
* Nothing is out of bounds.
* Everything is "in play"
* The "field of language" is the field of a game.

### overwhelming
* "strictly speaking, amounts to destroying the concept of the "sign" and its entire logic."
* supervene, v: 
  * happen after, but in a way that changes the situation
  * (philosophy) to be entailed by
* "supervenes at the moment when the extension of the concept of language effaces all its limits"
* "overwhelming and effacement have the same meaning"
* "as if the Western concept of language... were revealed today as the guise or disguise of a primary writing"
* Note 1: "primary writing" is not about chronological priority
  * The debate about the chronology is well known, but suspicious

### supplement
* either writing was never a "simple supplement to the spoken word"
* "or it is urgently necessary to construct a new logic of the supplement"

## causes

### necessity / choice
* "disguises" are not "historical contingencies"
* "a necessity that cannot be judged by any other tribunal"

### a moment of economy
* of "life" of "history" 
* or of "being as self-relationship"
* system of "hearing (understanding)-oneself-speak"
  * through "phonic substance"
  * _presents_ itself as nonexterior, nonmundane, nonempirical, noncontingent
  * has dominated the world for an epoch
  * has produced the idea of the world
  * "the idea of world-origin"
    * arises from the difference between worldly and non-worldly

## implications

### writing and technics
* the "slow movement", the movement of the "disguises"
  * success is "irregular and essentially precarious"
  * apparent goal: confining writing to a "secondary" and "instrumental" function
    * translator of "full speech"
    * interpreter of "originary speech itself shielded from interpretation"
    * "technics in the service of language"
      * not "general essence of technics"
      * of which "narrow" concept of writing is an example
      * rather "I believe" a "certain sort of question about meaning and origin of writing"
      * either "precedes" or "merges with" a certain question about the meaning and origin of technics.
      * Therefore technique "can never simply clarify the notion of writing"
* what is full speech:
  * fully present
  * present to self, signified, other
  * condition of "theme of presence in general"

### the adventure
* What we call language turns out to be a "species of writing"
* But it made us forget this
* "willfully"?
* as part of an adventure
* adventure "merges" with the "history that has associated technics and logocentric metaphysics" for 3,000 years.
* "approaching" its "own _exhaustion_"

### death of the book
* refers to end of "civilization of the book"
  * The enclosed, all encompassing tome
  * With a beginning and an end
  * e.g. "the bible", genesis, eschaton
  * manifests through "proliferation of libraries"
* announces death of "full" speech
  * timeline: a few centuries away
  * refers to a new situation for speech
  * "subordination within a structure of which it will no longer be the archon"
  * also new "mutation" in the history of writing
    * AND "in history as writing" [reflect]
    * since history and writing are mutually intertwined: events before writing are defined as "prehistory"

## definitions
Claim that writing exceeds and comprehends language implies:
* a certain definition of language
* a certain definition of writing
* must be justified to resist aforementioned "inflation"

### language
Has come to be used for:
* action, movement thought, reflection, consciousness, unconsciousness, experience, affectivity, etc.

### writing
* All those things and more.
* physical gestures of literal pictographic or ideographic inscription
* also totality of what makes it possible [reflect]
* also, "beyond the signifying face, the signified face itself"
* "all that gives rise to an inscription in general"
  * literal or not
  * even if it is outside "the order of the voice"
    * cinematography, choreography + pictorial, musical, sculptural "writing"
    * athletic writing
    * military or political writing "in view of the techniques that govern those domains today"
    * biology, _pro-gram_, writing of DNA
    * cybernetic program
      * even if it replaces soul, life, value, choice, memory "which until recently served to separate the machine from man"
      * must "conserve" "writing, trace gramme [written mark], or grapheme
      * "until its own historico metaphyiscal character is also exposed" [reflect: what is this?]

#### gramme as the element
* before human / nonhuman: the "gramme" / "grapheme" would "name the element"
* element without simplicity
  * whether understood as medium (like air) OR
  * as irreducible atom
* element of "arche-synthesis" in general
* Arche: Source, origin, first thing
* arche-synthesis in general: 
  * "what one must forbid oneself to define within the system of oppositions of metaphysics"
  * should not be called "experience" in general [reflect]
  * == the origin of meaning in general   

### remark
* can't define the origin of meaning
* it necessarily precedes definition

## timing: why now?
* "situation" always-already announced
* why does it now make itself known "as such and after the fact"?
* Answer requires "interminable analysis"
* Instead: some points of departure.

### theoretical mathematics

#### 3 interpretations of theoretical mathematical writing
1. "sensible _graphie_" / "manner of writing"
  * note: already presupposes identity / ideality of many marks
  * therefore, the "sensible signifier" does not make sense
2. "ideal synthesis of signifieds" / "trace operative on another level"
  * For example, the aggregate of ideal objects mathematical statements refer to.
3. "more profoundly": "the _passage_ of one to the other"
  * In this case, writing requires both "levels"
  * And refers to the process of connecting them.
  * That is, making sensible marks that evoke/invoke signifiers in the second layer

#### priority of writing in mathematics
* never "absolutely linked with a phonetic production"
* an enclave in cultures "practicing so-called phonetic writing"
* more than an enclave: location of challenge to metaphysics
* where scientific language challenges
  * ideal of phonetic writing
  * therefore metaphysics of phonetic writing
  * therefore metaphysics itself
  * particulary _epistémè_ and _istoria_
  * two concepts which are "detours _for the purpose of_ the reappropriation of presence"

#### remark
"a trace operative on another level"
* This slightly enigmatic phrase appears as an alternative to "ideal synthesis of signifieds"
* I think the idea is to complicate the division between "ideal" and "sensible." 
* This makes sense if we retain the division between the sensible graphie (as signifiers) and what this signifies, but without asserting that one is prior to the other, or that one is purely sensible and the other is purely ideal.
* Instead, we simply have two levels of sets of signifiers.
* This interpretation fits with the overall argument and the observation about the ideality of sensible graphie.

#### remark
_episteme_ and _istoria_
* "related" "in spite of the dissociation or opposition which has distinguished one from the other during one phase of their common progress"
* I expect there will be more elaboration of this point later.

#### information retrieval
* development of _practical methods_ of information retrieval
* extends the "message" so much
* message is no longer simply the "'written' translation of a language"
* no longer simply transports "a signified which could remain spoken in its integrity"
* aligns with phonography
* also "all means of conserving the spoken language" and "making it function without the presence of the speaking subject"
* note: phonetic writing is the medium of the adventure of the West
  * metaphysical, scientific, technical, economic
* implications:
  * phonetic writing is limited in space and time
  * "limits itself even" while "imposing its laws upon the cultural areas that had escaped it"
* "conjunction of cybernetics and the 'human sciences' of writing leads to a more profound reversal
  * Oh do not ask "What is it?" / Let us go and make our visit.
