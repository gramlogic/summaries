# The Program

## slow advent of writing
* slow movement over 20 centuries
* everthing that became "language" now is becoming "writing"
* hardly perceptible
* concept of writing is no longer derivative or auxillary
* "beginning to go beyond the extension of language"

### signifier of the signifier
* still writing
* no longer "accidental doubling"
* the movement of language
* the structure of the origin of writing
* "conceals and erases itself in its own production"
* "There the signified always already functions as a signifier."
* "Secondarity" particular to writing actually affects "all signifieds in general"
* the moment they "enter the game"

### the game
* What is this?
* Something related to play.
* "not a single signified that escapes, even if recaptured"
* What does "recapture" look like?

### play
* "the advent of writing is the advent of this play"
* "effacing the limit starting from which one had thought to regulate the circulation of signs"
* "reducing all the... out-of-bounds shelters that watched over the field of language"
* The metaphor is of playing a game.
* Nothing is out of bounds.
* Everything is "in play"
* The "field of language" is the field of a game.

### overwhelming
* "strictly speaking, amounts to destroying the concept of the "sign" and its entire logic."
* supervenes: 
  * happens after, but changes the situation
  * (philosophy) to be entailed by
* "supervenes at the moment when the extension of the concept of language effaces all its limits"
* "overwhelming and effacement have the same meaning"
* "as if the Western concept of language... were revealed today as the guise or disguise of a primary writing"
* Note 1: "primary writing" is not about chronological priority
  * The debate about the chronology is well known, but suspicious

### supplement
* either writing was never a "simple supplement to the spoken word"
* "or it is urgently necessary to construct a new logic of the supplement"

### necessity / choice
* "disguises" are not "historical contingencies"
* "a necessity that cannot be judged by any other tribunal"
