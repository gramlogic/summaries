# The Signifier and Truth
* This section claims the advent of writing shifts away from the metaphysical determination of truth.
* Then it explains why: 
  * truth has always been closely connected with speech
  * except in special cases where "writing" is used metaphorically.

## Claim

### Consequences of radicalized writing 
* The "rationality" that governs this primary writing "no longer issues from a logos."
* Same governing "rationality" "inaugurates" the "de-construction" of 
  * "all significations that have their sourcein the logos." 
  * Especially "truth"

#### rationality
Why Derrida suggests finding a new word:
* ratio is a translation of logos
* irrational numbers, for example, were "alogos"

#### paraphrase
* Whatever determines the behavior of this primary writing should not be called a "logic."
* One of projects this non-logic i bringing about is the deconstruction of all meanings derived from the logos.

#### Remark:
* Perhaps we could say grammar to name the collection of rules that control or describe the movement of this writing.

## The order of the logos

### "truth", logos
* All metaphysical determinations of truth 
  * Also the one "beyond metaphysical ontotheology that Heidegger reminds us of"
* are inseparable from 
  * the logos
  * a reason thought within the lineage of the logos
* whether truth its sense is
  * pre-Socratic
  * philosophical
  * God's infinite understanding
  * anthropological
  * pre-Hegelian
  * post-Hegelian

### truth, _phoné_
* "The original and essential link to the _phoné_ has never been broken."
* "the essence of the _phoné_ would be immediately proximate" to
* "that within which 'thought' as logos relates to 'meaning'"
* relates: "produces," "receives," "speaks," "composes"

#### remark
* Derrida uses scare quotes through this passage without much explanation.
* Quoted words include: rationality, thought, meaning, composes
* In French: rationalité, pensée, sens, rassemble
* The biggest hint are the quotes around "rationality" that he begins with and explains.
* Also, his treatment of "the event" in structure sign and play.
* Both indicate that the concept referred to by the quoted term is suspect.
* Similarly, the quotes around "thought" and "meaning" could be meant to indicate that, like "rationality," they are "significations that have their source in that of the logos."

#### question
'the essence of the _phoné_ would be immediately proximate to that which within "thought" as logos relates to "meaning"'
* simplified: 'the essence of the _phoné_ would be immediately proximate to that which relates to "meaning"'
  * without the extra phrase this makes sense.
  * What is meant by 'within "thought" as logos'?
  * Really, what is confusing is just "as logos" and the scare quotes.
  * Maybe "thought" as logos distinguishes it from other possible ways of conceiving "thought"?
  * Like, within metaphysics, thought is confined to and controlled by logos, meaning "reason"

#### question
Why is "compose" in scare quotes?
* rassembler... re-assembler...
* assemble: ad simul, to copy / simulate
* compose: place together

#### producer of the first signifier

##### Aristotle:
* spoken words represent mental experience
* written words represent spoken words

##### Why?
* "the voice, producer of _the first symbols_, has a relationship of essential and immediate proximity with the mind"

##### Voice:
* produces first signifier
* not just one among others
* signifies "mental experiences"

##### Mental Experiences:
* mirror things by natural resemblance

##### Natural signification:
* between being and mind
* things and feelings

##### Conventional symbolization:
* between mind and logos

##### Spoken language:
* first convention
* relates immediately to natural / universal signification

##### Written language:
* establishes conventions
* "interlinks other conventions"

##### Quotation from De interpretatione by Aristotle:
* we don't all have the same writing
* likewise not the same speech
* but we have the same mental experiences
* and so is exterior reality.
* spoken words are the "primary symbols" of mental experiences

##### Derrida's Commentary
* for Aristotle feelings of the mind are a kind of universal language, effaces itself
* Voice is always closest to signified:
  * signified "determined strictly as sense"
  * or "loosely as thing"
* All other signifiers are derivative.

##### Medieval theology
* alternative to Aristotle
* _res_ created from its _eidos_
* "thing is created from its sense"
* "thought in the logos or in the infinite understanding of God"

##### Writing as origin of signifier
* Writing is first among derivative signifiers.
* "Written signifier is always technical and representative"
* "has no constitutive meaning"
* 'This derivation is the very origin of the notion of the "signifier."' 

##### Sign / signifier / signified
* Sign always implies the signifier / signified distinction.
* So it "remains... within the heritage... of logocentrism"
* upholds proximity of:
  * "voice and being"
  * "voice and meaning of being"
  * "voice and the ideality of meaning"
* See Hegel for more evidence of privilege of sound in:
  * idealization
  * production of the concept
  * self-presence of the subject
 
##### Quotation from Hegel Part 1:
* See [in context](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55623/55623-h/55623-h.htm)
  * Under "Division of Subject"
  * Classification of arts by the sense they appeal to.
  * Only considers sight and hearing as capable of perceiving art.
  * After a paragraph on sight:
    "The remaining ideal sense is hearing. This is in signal contrast to the one just described. Hearing is concerned with the tone, rather than the form and colour of an object, with the vibration of what is corporeal; it requires no process of dissolution, as the sense of smell requires, but merely a trembling of the object, by which the same is in no wise impoverished. This ideal motion, in which through its sound what is as it were the simple individuality[17], the[Pg 14] soul of the material thing expresses itself, the ear receives also in an ideal way, just as the eye shape and colour, and suffers thereby what is ideal or not external in the object to appeal to what is spiritual or non-corporeal."
  * 17 Subjektivität, the ideal unity that is—not so much as soul or personality. ["Individuality" is much easier to understand than "subjectivity"]
* Quotation itself:
  * "This ideal motion" (the trembling) "in which"
  * "through the sound"
  * "the individuality" / "the soul of the material thing expresses itself"
  * "the ear receives" in a theoretical way
  * "allowing the interiority of the object" 
  * "to become interiority itself" [Derrida] / "to appeal to what is spriritual or non-corporeal"

##### Quotation from Hegel Part 1:
* See [in context](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55623/55623-h/55623-h.htm)
  * Under "Chapter 2, Music, Introduction", section 1.
  "In tone music forsakes the element of external form and its sensuous visibility, and requires for the apprehension of its results another organ of sense, namely hearing, which, as also the sight, does not belong to the senses of action but those y of contemplation; and is, in fact, still more ideal than sight. For the unruffled, aesthetic observation of works of art no doubt permits the objects to stand out quietly in their freedom just as they are without any desire to impair that effect in any way; but that which it apprehends is not that which is itself essentially ideally composed[380], but rather on the contrary, that which receives its consistency in its sensuous existence. The ear, on the contrary, receives the result of that ideal vibration of material substance[381], without placing itself in a practical relation towards the objects, a result by means of which it is no longer the material object in its repose, but the first example of the more ideal activity of the soul itself which is apprehended. And for the further reason that the negativity into which the oscillating medium here enters is from one point of view an annihilation of the spatial condition, which is itself removed by means of the[Pg 342] reaction of the body[382], the expression of this twofold negation, that is tone, is a mode of externality which, in virtue of its very mode of existence, is in its very origination self-destructive, and there and then itself fundamentally disappears. And it is by virtue of this twofold negation of externality, in which the root-principle of tone consists, that the same corresponds to the ideal personal life; this resonance which, in its essential explicitness[383], is something more ideal than the subsistent corporeality in its independent reality, also discloses this more ideal existence[384], and thereby offers a mode of expression suited to the ideality of conscious life."
* Quotation itself:
  * the ear perceives result of inner vibration without placing itself in practical relation toward the objects
  * consequence: rather than perceiving "the material form in its repose" (as in visual art)
  * perceives instead "more ideal activity of the soul itself"

### Being as presence

#### sound and _phoné_
* What Hegel claims about the sound in general holds also for the _phoné_ in particular
* _phoné_: speech sound / smallest discrete unit of speech
* subject affects itself / relates to itself through the _phoné_ in the system of "hearing (understanding)-oneself-speak"

#### phonocentrism and being as _presence_

### Roots of the sign

#### sensible and intelligible

#### other hidden sediments
* "reference to a signified able to 'take place' in its intelligibility"

### Why we cannot reject the sign 
Not a matter of rejection
The work of deconstruction
No linguistic sign before writing
