Introduction

## The problem of language
* always had special status
* now this status is apparent
* applies to diverse researches and discourses

### devaluation of the sign "language"
* using the word "language" for everything
* ironically, indicates a "loose vocabulary"

#### "ignorance":
* loose vocabulary
  * not using words precisely or consistently
* "temptation of a cheap seduction"
  * something related to desire... why is this ignorance?
* "passive yielding to fashion"
  * adopting usage without thinking about it
* "consciousness of the avant-garde"
  * consciousness of new, experimental, maybe trendy work
  * association with Dada and language poetry
  * is he saying the use of the word language reflects a belief that this is the direction new work is taking and a desire to represent oneself as being part of it?
  * If so, it might be ignorance of the history of the problem,
  * and ignorance to copy without "comprehension"

#### remark
The above sentence still confuses me, especially what seems like an attack on the avant-garde.

#### "inflation" and "language"
* "The inflation of the sign "language""
  * using the work language to refer to so many things
* "is the inflation of the sign itself"
  * because the sign comes to apply to everything
* "absolute inflation"
  * Because if everything is a sign then the word and concept of the sign no longer designates a difference, so no longer has meaning.
  * And if everything is a sign, this inflation applies to everything.
* "inflation itself"
  * If everything is inflated ("absolute inflation") then the sign "inflation" itself loses meaning.

#### remark
I agree that a word has to differentiate to have meaning. So for it to be meaningful to say something is a sign this must contrast to the idea of their being something that is not a sign. But I don't agree that, if it turns out everything is a sign, then the word sign loses its meaning. Instead it differentiates from an idea that turned out to be incoherent. It is also possible for a word to indicate an optional way of thinking about something. For example, something can be thought of as a sign, which implies a certain way of understanding it. It might also be thought of as a structure.
* So what is lost in this latter view of language is the "is". This may be what Derrida is pointing out. That the idea of an "essential" relationship between object and reference, which was part of the sign, is lost now as it becomes a "contingent" relationship.

#### interpreting this symptom
"still a sign: this crisis is also a symptom."
* Language is the entire system, but still also a word in the system.
* The "crisis" is this self-reference, by which the system seems to contain itself in its entirety.
* A sense of folding in on itself.

"indicates, as if in spite of itself, that a historic-metaphysical epoch _must_ finally determine as language the totality of its problematic horizon" 
* Because everything "desire" had hoped to remove from "the play" of language is recaptured
* because also: "language itself is menaced in its very life, adrift in the threat of limitlessness"
  * Meaning, if everything is language, we have the threat that language does not refer to anything outside itself.
  * "adrift" nothing to anchor to
* "brought back to its own finitude at the very moment when its limits seem to disappear"
  * "when it ceases to be self-assured, contained and _guaranteed"
  * "by the infinite signified which seemed to exceed it."

#### remark
* I'm not yet quite sure what he means by "brought back to its own finitude".
* I understand "the moment its limits seemed to disappear"
* And I understand the "infinite signified" as the "transcendental" signified
* A sign that it halfway outside of the system of signs
* But I don't understand yet why it's "infinite"

#### remark
The "infinite signified" is always referred to in the singular. But this doesn't make much sense unless we're talking about God. If we're talking about _noumena_, or axioms, there should be a plurality.
