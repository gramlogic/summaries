### Note about example
* Strictly speaking the argument is against the idea of the example.
* Will have to defend choices of examples

### Note about reading
* May be incomplete.
* Attempts to produce problems of critical reading.
* Part 1 argues that "reading should free itself, at least in its axis, from the classical categories of history:
  * history of ideas
  * history of literature
  * history of philosophy

#### remark
* Not sure what he means by this comment about "freeing itself"
* Or "axis"


### Approach to reading the "age" of Rousseau 
* Concerns:
  * structural figure
  * historical totality
* Attempt to relate two approaches
  * repeats question of the text
  * historical status
  * proper time and space
* "Age" in the _past_ is constituded as a _text_
  * In a sense of these words (past, text) to be established.
  * Conserves values of
    * legibility
    * efficacy of a model
  * disturbs 
    * time of the line
    * line of time
* Use Levi Strauss's "declared Rousseauism"
