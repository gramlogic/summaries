# Coda

I told my cat story in public twice.
* First time, the presenter before me fainted at the podium.
* Second time, I put my water on the table and was adjusting my microphone when the water spilled everywhere.
* My opening anecdote "about the ghost of my dead cat overturning a water glass was immediately preceded by an overturned water glass."
* "Make of that story what you will."

### Remarks
* Takeaway: Do not give this person a glass of water.
