# Extrasensory World
* "human perception cannot define the bounds of the universe"
* There must be things beyond our senses.
* For example cats can see in ultraviolet.
* This is probably how "jinn" work.

### Remarks
* This is one of the better arguments.
* But if the "universe" does not precede an "intra-action" then it would seem that nothing exists beyond what we intra-act with, so it's not clear whether Fernando really believes this.
* And if the extra-sensory beings become phenomena by having (perceptible) material effects, then in what way are they extrasensory?
