# The Material Real 

## Contradictory "truths"
* Hoppy knocked the flowers over.
* Hoppy is dead.
* It's Hoppy's ghost.
* Ghosts aren't "real"

## Exclusive Humanism 
* Dipesh Chakrabarty: secular social sciences have trouble with supernatural agency
* Reason: humans are the only agents
* Charles Taylor: "exclusive humanism" (_A Secular Age_)
  * based in a "buffered" sense of the sense
  * Not "vulnerable" to interference by "spirits"
* "Secularity is thus anchored by an exclusive focus on human flourishing, where the human is understood as bounded or buffered"

## Political / scholarly focus on anthropocene
* highlights "urgent proximity of nonhuman presences" (Amitav Ghosh)
* Humans always already in relation to nonhumans
* Agency of nonhumans "and things"(!)
* Link between human flourishing and "nonhuman" worlds
* "porosity" of human subjects, dependency and vulnerability to nonhuman agents
* Maybe posthumanism is "postsecular"

### remark
* This totally rewrites the idea of "agency"
* Use of "nonhuman" is expanded to include "immaterial"
* "porosity" is expanded from Haraway's concept to have something to do with supernatural

## Beyond the secular age
* Marisol de la Cadena: human agency hinges on separation between "Nature" and "Humanity"
* Fernando: effort to "reentangle" human and nonhuman disrupts some elements of the "secular age" and priveleges others
* Two spheres of the nonhuman: nature and "supernatural"
* Modern conception of humanity:
  * Distinguished from natural (realm of scientific fact)
  * Supernatural (metaphysical or symbolic phenomena)
* Secular-modern Man emerged as Man by freeing himself from entanglements with both worlds
* Recently some attempt to re-entangle with nature.
* But not with "supernatural"
* "not sure I could write a feline parallel to Donna Haraway's dog manifesto, in which species companionship engaged not just my living cat but my dead one too, and remain intelligible to my peers"
  * why not?
  * "secular-modern attachments to the material and visible as the site of the real"
  * "read generously against the grain... posthumanism can ... [go] beyond the material"

### remark
The whole of secular agency has always been founded on the immaterial.
