# Supernatureculture

## Golden Snail Opera
* Video and text
* Set in rice field in Taiwan's Lanyang Plain
* Speaking characters: Farmer, Pedant, Wanderer (ghost).
* Film's video perspectives: snail, dog, people
* Stage performance: Pedant and Farmer can't see the ghost (farmer can "feel" it a little)

## Fernando's questions
* Can the animals "see" the ghost?
* Can we learn to see the ghost?
  * Using Islamic science of the unseen
  * Opening self to dreams
* Opera says: "it seems difficult to ban ghosts... This... messes with European Enlightenment notions of nature, but isn't that part of the point?"
* Fernando says: "Indeed."
* Can the work of undoing the nature / culture distinction also help with the supernature / nature distinction?
* What if instead of "natureculture" we call it "supernatureculture"?
* Is that better?
