# Immaterial matter

Haraway
* No pre-constituted subjects and objects
* Contingent foundations
* result: "bodies that matter"

Fernando
* Can the immaterial also matter?
* Haraway seems to suggest the materiality of the dog is contingent
* Does she assume material existence as a precondition?

### Remark
* If your cat's ghost is immaterial, how did it knock over your water?
* Material is infectious. Anything that interacts with material is material.
* Materiality is a condition of relating.

Phenomena
* not "independent objects"
* Barad says "Bohr's" phenomena are "are the _ontological_ inseparability of agentially intra-acting components." 
* "distinct agencies... emerge through intra-action" 

### Remark
* Very strange to attribute "phenomena" to Niels Bohr. Maybe she means Kant?
* I don't think Bohr or Kant said "agentially intra-acting components" or would have known what to make of that phrase.
* Grammatically, this sentence seems to have problems because it says "phenomena are the ... inspearability"
* Beyond all that, the distinction between inter- and intra- action is trivial. It depends on whether the agencies/objects are considered independent or not. If there are no idependent objects, everything is intra-action between components. This only means that components are the new objects.
* It would make more sense to recognize that both perspectives are equally compelling. Everything that can be understood as interaction between objects can also be re-imagined as intra-action between components of a larger object. 
* The claim that they are not objects but "agencies" requires additional major argument that Ferdando accepts without discussion. This amounts to argument by authority.
* The claim that object/agencies do no "precede" intra-action, but rather "emerge" through "intra-action" is dogmatic.
  * There is no possible objective view of these "agencies."
  * The smallest possible interaction is therefore between subject and some other.
  * Since the encounter between subject and other is an interaction, the subject cannot say anything about the non-existence of this object before the encounter.

Fernando
* phenomena doesn't exclude nonmaterial beings
* nonmaterial beings can "constitute themselves" "thought their intra-action with other material and nonmaterial beings"
* would not need to take material form to be phenomena in "Bohr's own terms"
* But Barad assumes materiality.
* But that's OK because maybe we can imagine cat-ghosts as non-material beings that have material _effects_.

### Remark
* Again, there is zero chance that "Bohr's own terms" are being used here.
* The cat-ghost is beyond the world but able to affect it. So, it is a classic metaphysical construction.

## Brittlestar
* Limbs break off and continue to move and emit light.
* Helps distract predators.
* Barad concludes: Connectivity does not require contiguity.
* Fernando conclues: just like the ghost of my dead cat!
* Fernando asks: why is it so hard for people to accept the "intra-action constitutive of nonhuman spirits and humans"?
