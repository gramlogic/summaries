# Strong AI: Can Machines Really Think?
"Many philosophers have claimed that a machine that passes the Turing Test would still not be _actually_ thinking..."
* Turing calls this the argument from consciousness, cites an example from Geoffrey Jefferson
* R&N characterize this argument as the claim that "the machine has to be aware of its own mental states and actions"
* R&N correct Turing, claiming the "key point actually relates to phenomenology"
* R&N define phenomenology as "the study of direct experience" and add "the machine has to actually feel emotions"
* R&N also bring up "intentionality" and claim "others focus on" this.
* R&N define "intentionality" as the question of whether the machine's purported beliefs, desires, and other representations are actually 'about' something in the real world."
* No effort made to explain what the real world is supposed to mean.

## Mental states and the brain in a vat

## Functionalism and the brain replacement experiment

## Biological naturalism and the Chinese room

## Consciousness, qualia, and the explanatory gap

"we are interested in creating programs that behave intelligently. The additional project of making them conscious is not one that we are equipped to take one, nor one whose success we would be able to determine."
