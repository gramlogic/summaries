# Philosophical Foundations
Goals:
* What it means to think
* Can "artifacts" do this?
* What are the ethical implications

Terms:
* weak AI: "machines can act as if they are intelligent"
* strong AI: it is possible for machines to actually think

Remark:
"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for grants, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis"
