# What is AI?
Four classes of definitions, combining 2 characteristics
* Focus on thought vs behavior
* Measurement: actual human vs "rationality"

Rationality: 
* "an _ideal_ performance measure... A system is rational if it does the "right thing," given what it knows."

Remark:
* A human-centered approach must be empirical and based on study of human behavior.
* "A rationalist approach involves a combination of mathematics and engineering."

## Acting Humanly

### Turing Test:
* Alan Turing, 1950
* "A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer."
* See Ch 26 for details and "whether a computer would realy be intelligent if it passed"

To pass, the computer would need the following capabilities:
* natural language processing
* knowledge representation
* automated reasoning
* machine learning (to adapt and extrapolate)

### Total Turing Test
Adds:
* Video signal to test perception
* ability to pass objects "through the hatch"

Requirements:
* Computer vision
* Robotics

Remarks:
* "These six disciplines compose most of AI, and Turing deserves credit for designing a test that remains relevant 60 years later. Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing Test..."
* Artificial flight "succeeded when the Wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds..."
* "Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as "making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons"

Interjection:
* This is stunningly arrogant.
* Thinking is not like flying.

## Thinking Humanly
The cognitive modeling approach
* Example: work on General Problem Solver by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon

Three ways to understand human minds:
* Introspection
* pyschological experiments
* brain imaging

Claims:
* "Once we have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible to express the theory as a computer program."
* "If the programs input-output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program's mechanisms could also be operating in humans."

### Cognitive Science
Testable theories of human mind from:
* Computer models from AI
* Experimental psychology

We now distinguish between the claims 
* that an algorithm performs well on a task
* that an algorithm is a good model for human performance

Claims:
* Computer vision is an example of an area in which the two fields are mutually compatible.
* CV incorporates "neurophysiological evidence into computational models"

## Thinking Rationally
* "right thinking" == "irrefutable reasoning processes"
* credit to Aristotle's syllogisms
* study of "laws of thought" == logic

19th century logic
* precise notation for objects and relations in the world
* "Contrast this with ordinary arithmetic notation, which provides only for statements about _numbers_."

logicist tradition
* hopes to build logic solvers into intelligent systems
* obstacle 1: hard to take informal knowledge and formalize it (hard to handle uncertainty)
* obstacle 2: many problems are intractable 
* Note both of the above obstacles always apply, we just noticed them first in the logicist tradition

## Acting Rationally

"agent"
* something that acts
* Latin agere, "to do"

computer agent expectations
* operate autonomously
* perceive environment
* persist over a prolonged time period
* adapt, change and create and pursue goals

rational agent
* acts to achieve the best outcome
* in uncertainty, best expected outcome
