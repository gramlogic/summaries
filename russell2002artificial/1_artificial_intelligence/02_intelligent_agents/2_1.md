# Agents and Environments

**agent**: anything that perceives its **environment** through **sensors** and acts on the environment using **actuators**.

Simpler:
* An agent is what perceives and acts.
* The environment is what an agent perceives and acts on.
* Sensors are what an agent perceives with.
* Actuators are what an agent acts with.
Note complete circularity: we haven't defined perceiving or acting.

Examples:
* Human (eyes, hands)
* Robot (camera, motors)
* Software (keystrokes/input, display/output)

Percept: input at an "instant"
percept sequence: total history of all percepts.
Agent function:
* maps percept sequence to action
* Agent Function Table: **external characterization**
* Agent function: "abstract mathematical characterization"

The agent program:
* **internal implementation**
* "concrete" implementation

Vacuum world example:
* If dirty, then suck, else move.
* What's the best way to fill out the table? (vacuum ethics)

Caveat:
* Don't look too hard at our use of the word "agent"
* We know it could be applied to basically anything, because anything can receive input and produce output.
* But uhhh just use it when it feels right, ok?
