# Bibliographical and Historical Notes
Central role of action in intelligence.
* "Practical reasoning"
* Back to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics
* Also McCarthy's "Programs with Common Sense" (1958)

Robotics and Control theory:
* Controller in control theory is identical to agent in AI.

Agents vs its components:
* Historically, AI has focused on components:
  * question-answering systems
  * theorem-provers
  * vision systems, etc.
* Exception: Genesereth and Nilsson _Logical foundations of artificial intelligence_ (1987)
* Whole-agent view is now widely accepted
  * Developing Intelligent Agent Systems, A practical guide by Lin Padgham & Michael Winikoff
  * Jones, T. (2007). Artificial Intelligence: A Systems Approach. Infinity Science Press.
  * Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents David L. Poole and Alan K. Mackworth

Rationality:
* Periperhal interest in AI until mid 1980s.
* Jon Doyle, 1983 predicted rational agent design would become core mission (?)

Environment properties:
* Heavy contributions from control theory tradition
  * classical control: fully observable, deterministic environments
  * stochastic optimal control: partially observable, stochastic environments
  * hybrid control: environments with discrete and continuous elements
* dynamic programming, from operations research: also concerned with fully and partially observable environments 
* Lots of work to find efficient algorithms for keeping track of complex environments

Simple reflex agents:
* Central to behaviorist pyschology
* "Most AI researchers view them as too simple to provide much leverage"
* Rosenschein (1985) and Brooks (1986) question this

Goal-based agents:


The goal-based view of agents also dominates the cognitive psychology tradition in thearea of problem solving, beginning with the enormously influential Human Problem Solv-ing (Newell and Simon, 1972) and running through all of Newellâ€™s later work (Newell, 1990). Goals, further analyzed as desires (general) and intentions (currently pursued), are central to the influential theory of agents developed by Michael Bratman (1987).

Utility-Based agents:

## File elsewhere
Turing's insight is simply that if intelligence can only manifest in behavior, artificial intelligence is possible. If however, there is an aspect of intelligence that is purly unobservable, then there is no way to satisfy our critics, but this applies as well to human intelligence.
