AI is the science of agent design.
* Agent perceives and acts in an environment.
* Agent function takes percept sequence and returns actions.
* Perfomance measure evaluates behavior in an environment.
* Rational agent maximizes the performance measure given percept sequence.
* Task environment: performance measure, external environment, actuators and sensors.
* First step in agent design is to specify the environment.
* Task environments vary along several major dimensions.
* If the performance measure is unknown the agent might optimize the wrong objective. Should instead reflect uncertainty about objective.
* Agent program implements agent function. Selecting from a variety of basic designs depends on envirnoment.
* 4 types of agents.
* All agents can use learning to improve performance.
