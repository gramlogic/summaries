# Money

Modern prison
* central to carceral geography
* not the only important thing
* carceral geography is related to accumulation

History of modern prison and money

Transition in the role of money
* from a means to move stored energy
* to an end
* not to keep, but to increase

Racial capitalism
* always relied on hierarchy
* hierarchy depended on vulnerability to premature death
* exploited by elites as part of exploitation of nature / other in general
* needed to justify inequality

Racial capitalism
* started in agriculture, perfected in slavery
* furthered through imperial war-making
* peers paying taxes to increasingly central sovereign
* militaries less able to pay themselves by looting
* eventually paid in land
* so land was turned into money

Modern prisons grew up with the US
* penitentiaries helped establish the state
* enforced as punishment against people who didn't know their place as described by racial capitalism
* racial capitalism is animated by people who make things and care for people
* who was out of place?
  * unfree people
  * people who couldn't prove they were free
  * people whose skin / bones put them in a narrative that defaults to unfreedom

Racial capitalism requires scheming
* by "elites" and "compradors"
* comprador: "a person within a country who acts as an agent for foreign organizations engaged in investment, trade, or economic or political exploitation. 
* putting money / resources isn't very attractive
* but... there are millions of prime-age people in them

Prison is not slavery
* Not a factory
* Not a way to harness labor

Where's the profit?
* Prisons are extractive
* They enable money to move because of inactivity
* They take people out of communities
* They take away "time"

Bodies as places
* Time is taken out of bodies
* a hole in a life
* stolen "social wage" 
* money that would go to the prison goes elsewhere
* "extraction, in money form, from direct producers whose communities are destabilized"

Money gives insight into alternatives
* The enormity of possible inhabitants and makers of abolition geographies
* an interlocking pattern across the terrain of racial capitalism

### remark
It's as if there is a tesselation, and she's flipping the negative space.
