# Abolition Geography

* Freedom is a place
* Place-making is a "normal" human activity.
* We combine people, land and resources
* Each factor comes in "types" which "determine" but do not "define" what should be done.

Abolitionist Critique
* concerned with details of arrangements of people, resources and land over time 
* Shows how relationships of "un-freedom" consolidate and stretch (expand and contract)
* The point is to identify "central contradictions" in regimes of dispossession
* also to show how radical consciousness in action leads to liberation
* Gets meaning and method from radical tradition
  * This tradition goes back in "time-space"
  * Not to abolish history
  * to find alternatives to despairing view that we are not making progress
  * just redistributing human sacrifice 
* What is to be abolished:
  * Not the past, or the present it led to (its ghost)
  * yes, the process of hierarchy, dispossession and exclusion that "congeal in" group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death

Supreme Court decision
* Suprising
* Agreed that California could not "build its way out" of neglect
* But opposition to the neglect / scandal is not a turn away from prison itself
* Changes at the margin
* Most people are in the center, not at the scandal
* That is, the problem with prisons is that they work they way they are supposed to
* "to enclose people in situations where they are expected...to sicken and die"

The history of "epochal ordinariness" of mass criminalization
* multi-decade crisis-riven economy made surpluses
  * land, people, money-capital, state capacity
  * these led to prison expansion 
  * the "prison fix"
* Enormously complicated people, income and asset-rich economy made a sudden turn
  * repurposed land
  * redirected social wage
  * used public debt
  * removed lots of people from households and communities 

Something changed. Therefore:
* instead of imagining "persistent reiteration of static relations"
* let's analyze relationship dynamics beyond obvious conceptual or spatial boundaries
* Decide what a "form" is made of by trying to change it
* Strategy of "negation"
* Wonder about "form's present, future-shaping design"
* We can figure this out from the patterns that make it up
* No need to be distracted by its "social ancestors"

Geography
* inductively: there are forms
* deductively: patterns reveal generalities (forms?)
* geographers go back and forth
* try  to explain formalities and improvisations of place-making
  * shaped by human/environmental replationships of "dependency"
  * coupling of power with difference
  * interrupted (sometimes) by preventable fatalities
* human sacrifice as organizing principle
* This relates to racial capitalism and criminalization.


Challenge of complex totality:
* Effect of many advocacy efforts is to reveal, bit by bit, the breath-taking structure of mass incarceration
* tends to legitimize the whole by focusing on narrow categories
  * youth, women, parents, mothers, men, gender nonconforming people, the aged, the infirm
* or history of what produced it
  * (war on drugs, stop and frisk, racism, privatization)
* But particular affects more than just one thing
  * "extraction of time" from one body affects other bodies
  * parents, children, communities, movements
* And particular implies churn of whole geographies
  * gentrification, auto / steel manufacturing, coal mining, gold mining, conflict materials, fracking...
* Challenge is to keep the entirety of carceral geographies connected without collapsing or reducing aspects into each other
* Need for analytical "stretch" to perceive "the material world" in overlapping / interlocking totalities
* Requires more "critical self-conscousness"
* What's real "matters absolutely"
* the experience of the real will never automatically reveal how and why negation sometimes succeeds.
* negation: the thorough reworking on materiality and consciousness

Prison as a catchall solution to social problems.
* Wherever inequality is deepest.

The form of the attack
* Ideologically = "in thought and everyday culture
* twin processes of "centralization and devolution"
* "patterned" by sensibility of permanent crisis
* are expressed and normalized
* And this shapes structures of feeling, and therefore socially determines what appears to be possible in terms of resistance.

Devolution as partition
* "doctrine of devolution" produces fragmenting objects of antagonism
* Hard to know where to direct opposition
* "normalizing capacities" of partition [reminds me of Said's specialization]
* shapes the attacks against it
  * policing, immigration, terrorism, budget activism, injunctions, sexuality, gender, age, premature death, parenthood, privatization, formerly and currently incarcerated people, public sector unions, devalued labor, and relative innocence
* Racism connects and differentiates these categories
* Policy as script for future [program]
  * Sharp (to pierce the future)
  * Not narrow
* Economics determine, the politics of race define techniques and understanding (Sivanandan)
  * Not set in concrete (but solid...)
  * Race is the modality through which class is lived
  * Mass incarceration is _class_ war
  * So, to fight partition, we want breadth

Argument for terms
* Breadth is also challenging
* Our questions shape our answers
* What are the "most adequate" general terms to gather things together?
* Example, "Beyond the Prison Industrial Complex" from Critical Resistance
  * Supposed to be broad, using military industrial complex as a template
  * But in many cases the effect was atrophy of imaginative understanding of "boundless boundary-making"
  * Researchers spend too much time proving trivial things or beating back hostile critiques
  * Activists fight scandal rather than sources
* Proposed term: carceral geographies instead of pic
* Goal is to renovate _abolition_ 

"Abolition Democracy" (W.E.B. Du Bois)
* Du Bois saw places people made in this project
* Brought with them a "complement of consciousness and capacity"
  * sensibilities, dependencies, talents
* To remake where they were into where they wanted to be
* Evidence that abolition is more than absence of legal enslavement and property form

Reconstruction place-making
* negated the negation of bondage
* No one is fully out of bondage because of property
  * Birth of a Nation made whiteness desirable / obligatory [I think this should go here rather than in the confusing spot it appears]
* But consciousness remains in culture

Elite activities
* To enhance ability to extract value from labor and land
* create political, economic and cultural institutions
* using ideologies and methods from everywhere
* Build and modify states.
* Promote and deflate explanations of why the world should be otherwise, or should be as it is
* In other words, elites produce and disseminate ideology

Elite problems
* they rely of structures of order that "the anarchy" of racial capitalism can never guarantee.
* non-elites are not passive

4 Examples
* Gaza and West Bank
  * infrastructure for postcolonial Palestine
  * requiring persistent work on consciousness
* Domestic Violence
  * imagining how to replace need for law enforcement intervention
  * change social relationships
* Decolonial Education
  * curricular development
* Oakland anti-gang injunctions
  * these allow people named to be questioned and searched at all times
  * To fight it required transforming consciousness
  * extraordinary commitment to ordinary things: garden and a mural




A struggle here to reconcile division of "identity" with goal of abolition.
Same as Haraway--how do we build a coalition that isn't dismissive.
The question is how do we imagine ourselves and therefore the future that is possible.
 
scandal vs source
Pierce the future for hope
Struggling with an imagination of the future.
Certainly Gilmore is struggling with a kind of metaphysics
"real" vs negation"?
Is Ruth Wilson Gilmore a radical?
Rhetoric seems relentless centrist, rarely racial
Epochal ordinariness
the "prison fix"
"negation"
"overlapping / interlocking" totalities
human sacrifice is key
group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death


"Each of these factors... comes in a number of types, all of which determine but do not define what can or should be done."

What is determine vs. define?
