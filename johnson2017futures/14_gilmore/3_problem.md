# The Problem of Innocence

The "perilous" argument:
* Prisons are bad for X
* X = women, aged, infirm, youth, mothers, transgender, gender non-conforming, non-violent criminals
* Establishes that some people _should_ be in prison
* Does this by distinguishing degrees of innocence, so some people will be permanently not innocent
* Uses logic of criminalization
  * about identifying the guilty, so even by its own logic it is wrong
  * But this yields too much 

Driving the innocence argument
* "Should not be in cages" categories
* Also belief that this is the continuation of uncompensated labor
* effort to replace loss of universal rights with a "category"

Problems with this argument:
* half the people locked up are not descendants of racial chattel slavery.
  * They form a large block.
  * But we need a different explanation and different politics.
* "uncritical extension of a partial past to explain a different present demands a sentimental political assertion"
* depends on laboring victim who can be rehabilitated or expunged into relative innocence
* the criteria of innocence can change
* The "negation of the negation" is possible and can go in unpredictable directions, recalibrate power differentials

Example: innocence and strategy of the anti-state state
* the anti-state state
  * states are bad and should shrink
* mass incarcertation and anti-state state
  * is its bedrock
  * leads to devolution--off-loading responsibility to increasingly local institutions
* carceral humanitarianism and anti-state state
  * new formation of saturation policing: stop and frisk, broken windows, "community policing"
  * a domestic counterinsurgency program
  * also a feature of the anti-state state
  * aggrandizing police organizations
  * targeting the relatively innocent
  * uses goods and services everyone needs (esp. poor)
  * But the catch is collaboration with carceral geographies that created the problem
* Making a common cause with the architects is a bad plan

Slavery and innocence
* Redress of slavery is not related to proving innocence of slaves
* Orlando Patterson: the power to kill leads to domination
* The power to incarcerate also derives from the power to kill
  * death penalty
  * life sentence
  * police killings
* Patterson: "One fell because he was the enemy; the other became the enemy because he had fallen"?

Conclusion:
* Human sacrifice, not innocence is the central organizing principle of carceral geography.
* Innocence argument skips "how to diminish and remedy harm" as opposed to how to find better forms of punishment.
* Tubman quote:
  * Prisoner made free, finds no one to welcome him.
  * Slave made free, no one to welcome her.
  * I will make a home for them.
[what in the hell do these 3 things have in common?]
