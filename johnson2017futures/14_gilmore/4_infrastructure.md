# Infrastructure of Feeling

Why did Du Bois revise his estimate of the number of people Tubman helped?
* From hundreds to thousands
* Gilmore suggests Du Bois's interview with Tubman gave him visionary insight
* Maybe Du Bois came to understand abolition geographies being created in time / space
* concept of "infrastructure of feeling" helps with this
  * Suggestion is that Du Bois reselected his ancestors
* helps us understand how abolition geographies tend toward "negation of negation" of carceral geographies
  * carceral geography is itself the first negation

Structure of feeling
* Raymond Williams: each age has a narrative structure for understanding material limits to possibility of change
* Paul Gilroy: there are more than one per age, and they are dialectical
* Williams: tradition is an accumulation of these structures
* They accumulate through "the selection of ancestors"

Black Radical Tradition
* accumulation of structures of feeling that tend toward freedom
* modernity's explosions and distortions invoked difference, possession, dependence, abundance
* black radical tradition's selection of ancestors therefore is about "unbounded participatory openness"

Infrastructure of feeling
* Answer to: "What "underlies" this accumulation" of structures of feeling?
* I.e. What is the purpose / cause of it?
* A "consciousness-foundation, sturdy but not static" that gives the capacity to select "liberatory lineages"
* Within a lifetime, and across generations

Therefore: 
* Black Radical Tradition is "shaped by... consciousness of and direction toward unboundedness..."
* Must move away from partition and exclusion
