# Unboundedness, Against Conclusion

Abolition Geography:
* How people make freedom
* How people imagine _home_
* How they resist partition / carceral geography
* Elaborates the human-environment ("spatial") process of abolition democracy
* Is "capacious" (not just black people)
* Is specific (action for understanding how to work together)
* Believes feeling and agency produce structure as much as they are constrained by it
* A way of studying, organizing, being, "worlding ourselves"
* Challenges assumption that territory and liberation can be
  * taken away or restricted.
  * partitioned by sales / laws / walls
* Asserts that by seizing our capacities and repeating ourselves, we will change ourselves the world. 

### remark
There is a connection here I think to Baldwin's Strange in the Village: "will never be white again."

Story of California Department of Corrections
* 1970s: experimented with disruptive schemes to end solidarity among population
* Too much cooperation was creating court defeats and retaliation against guards
* Plan: segregate prisoners into racial, ethnic, and regional groups, call the groups "gangs"
* Put some in indefinite solitary
* Restrict punishment to "snitch, parole, die"
* Built new prisons with high-tech Security Housing Units (SHU) to enforce this
* Lawyers and others have been working with SHU, regardless of innocence, trying to get rid of these things
* CDC insists that "gangs" run the prisons and the streets
* After 40 years, the impact definitely reaches beyond the prison
* SHU attempts to "mix" people from different geographies to minimize solidarity
* Can't see or touch, but can talk and listen
* For a long time kept concept of "race"

Hunger strikes:
* Resistance to torture through self-directed violence
* First strike
  * All "gangs" represented
  * Demands: better food, improved visitation, evidence-based contestation of SHU sentences
  * CDC offered to negotiate but nothing changed.
* Second strike
  * Covered by in-prison grapevine and free-world support
  * Demands: end to hostilities among races
  * Left no group out

Racial capitalism
* Race is always important
* Rooted in group differentiation to premature death, not color
* PBSP finds example of opposition through solidarity across racial groups
* "fiction of race" has real and deadly effects

Gilmore sees race as a tool of racial capitalism, and any division as enforcing carceral logic.

The result is a politics of radical inclusion.
To be clear, I don't think this means erasing difference.
That is, it's not the same as saying "I don't see color."
But it is an argument for shifting identity away from race.
